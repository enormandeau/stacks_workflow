"""Reorder samples in VCF

Usage:
    <program> input_vcf wanted_order output_vcf

Where:
    input_vcf is the name of the VCF file to filter (can be compressed with gzip, ending in .gz)
    wanted_order has one sample name per line (identical to sample names from the VCF to treat)
    output_vcf is the name of the filtered VCF (can be compressed with gzip, ending in .gz)
