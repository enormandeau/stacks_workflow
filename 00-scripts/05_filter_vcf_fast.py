"""Filtering SNPs in VCF file output by STACKS1 or STACKS2 minimaly

Usage:
    <program> input_vcf min_cov percent_genotypes max_pop_fail min_mas output_vcf [group_all]

Where:
    input_vcf: is the name of the VCF file to filter (can be compressed with gzip, ending in .gz)
    min_cov: minimum allele coverage to keep genotype <int>, eg: 4 or more
    percent_genotypes: minimum percent of genotype data per population <float> eg: 50, 70, 80, 100
    max_pop_fail: maximum number of populations that can fail percent_genotypes <int> eg: 1, 2, 3
    min_mas: minimum number of samples with rare allele <int> eg: 2 or more
    output_vcf: is the name of the filtered VCF (can be compressed with gzip, ending in .gz)
    group_all: whether to consider all samples as one population <int> 0, 1 (default: 0)

WARNING:
    The filtering is done purely on a SNP basis. Loci are not taken into account.
